// Write a script that starts with two variables: hours and wage. Then write the code to log the total paycheck based on the 
// hours worked and the wage ($ per hour). If the hours worked is over 40, give 150% pay for the extra hours worked. Try running 
// it with a few different values for hours and wage. Here are some examplesâ€¦

// Next, if this person got the same paycheck every week, count how many weeks it would take them to earn $1,000,000. Give the 
// answer as a whole number. For example, with wage=10 and hours=50 it would take 1819 weeks.
